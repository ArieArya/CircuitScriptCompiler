# Virtual Machine (VM)

This is the CircuitScript VM, written in portable C++. The VM executes intermediate representation (IR) generated by the CircuitScript compiler.

## Executing Files

Pass the file name of the IR file as the first argument to execute it:
```bash
circuit_script <file_name>
```

## Building

We use Meson and Ninja as our build system.

```bash
cd vm
meson setup build
cd build
ninja
```

The `circuit_script` binary is now located in `vm/build`.
